# Bitcoin Miner Written in Python

A quick project to understand the mechanics of bitcoin mining. Something I always wanted to learn more about ðŸ˜€

## Example Output

```
start mining
Bitcoin mining successful with nonce value: 12731
end mining. Mining took: 0.03285503387451172 seconds
0000297a654cf44268cd6c139616e50e7849c5bf900e05d864687875c1f6b614

```


### Take a look at the code, its actually a relatively simple little thing!
